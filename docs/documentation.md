## Customizing Tinker

which will open the built-in Theme Customizer. On the left hand side you'll see all available settings while on the right is a live preview of all the changes that you make.

Using the theme customizer you can change the following settings:

**Modify site title and tagline.** Note that site tagline is not shown on Tinker frontend but it’s included in the source code for SEO purposes.

**Set colors** for background, links, header text and menu items, body text and headlines.

**Enable or disable site-wide breadcrumb navigation** which is used to illustrate the site structure and give an instant understand of visitors location on the site.

**Enable or disable your profile picture from Gravatar in site header.** Tinker will use the administrators email address (set under Settings → General in WordPress backend) for the Gravatar image, so make sure you have setup a photo for that email address on gravatar.com.

**Automatically place featured images** after the post title on blog archive pages and also when viewing individual posts and pages.

**Enable footer menu area for a different set of menu links in the footer.** Useful for linking to your social profiles on Twitter, Facebook, GitHub, Flickr, etc.

**Use your profile photo from Gravatar as favicon.** People who have bookmarked your blog will see your profile photo in their bookmark bar.

**Place the contents of your custom posts page before the blog.** Useful for describing the nature of your blog as well as adding a short bio.
